# Welcome to Tom De Groote's Repo!

Hey there! My name is Tom De Groote and I'm a Java developer from Flanders, Belgium. I've been coding for over 10 years and have a lot of experience in developing and maintaining software applications.

But enough about work, let's get to the fun stuff! When I'm not busy writing code, I love spending time with my husband and our adopted child. We love going on adventures and exploring new places. I'm also a big fan of video games and can often be found playing the latest releases on my gaming console.

I'm excited to share my projects with you and hope you find them useful. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to chat.

Thanks for stopping by and have a great day!
